A simple console app to constantly upload video from your webcam to OneDrive


### Why?

There's no need to pay for commercial products if everything you need comes with your laptop.


### How?

Requirements:

 * [Microsoft Expression Encoder 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18974)
 * .NET Framework 4.5.2
 * Visual Studio 2015

### Who?

This app does not have a GUI, so if you don't know basic programming you probably shouldn't use it for yourself. Sorry. :disappointed:


### Customization

The default video storage path and video length are stored in app.config. You can change them and compile a new executable to use the updated settings.

If you'd like the option for command line parameters, you can always fork the repository and do it yourself.
